<p><h4>Welcome to my unconsciously fictional autobiography</h4></p><p>I expect that most of what I write here will be about things I have already experienced and therefore from my unique memory of them. </p><p>A <a href="http://www.radiolab.org">radiolab</a> podcast about <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/2007/jun/07/#.TldHoxmMajg.blogger">Memory and Forgetting</a> described how every time we recall a memory it is rewritten and that each time it is rewritten it is slightly modified. So that each time we remember something the memory becomes less accurate. </p><p>Maybe some of my fiction will be incorporated into the fiction of the reader, which is ultimately the point of this. </p><p>Thank you </p>
